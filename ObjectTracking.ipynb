    "\n",
    "### <b> 1. Occlusion\n",
    "- `Challenge:` Occlusion occurs when an object being tracked is partially or fully hidden by another object or leaves the camera's field of view. This can lead to loss of object identity or tracking failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Example:` In apedestrian tracking system, a person walking behind a parked car may become temporarily invisible.\n",

    "- `Multi-Camera Systems:` Use multiple cameras to maintain visibility from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b> 2. Motion Blur\n",
    "- `Challenge:` Fast-moving objects can cause motion blur in images, making it difficult to extract clear features for tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Example:` In sports tracking, a fast-moving soccer ball may appear as a streak rather than a distinct object.\n",
